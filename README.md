## ✨ Brand Values

Mukyala isn’t just another spa; it is an ethos built on respect, timeless elegance, and nurturing technology. These values drive both our in-person service and every line of code in this app.

| Pillar                                         | What it means                                                   | Real-world example                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Old-School Customer Service for Everyone**   | We know our guests by name and treat each with genuine respect. | The receptionist greets a long-time guest by name and remembers their favourite treatment. |
| **Luxury & Timeless Experiences**              | Every interaction should feel indulgent and enduring.           | Warm essential-oil towels are offered during a massage to elevate relaxation.              |
| **Technology that Enhances, not Hurries**      | AI and notifications encourage, never pressure.                 | A push reminder says _“We think your skin will love this!”_ instead of a hard sell.        |
| **Consistency through Positive Reinforcement** | Gentle, celebratory nudges help guests stay on track.           | _“Great job! Your skin is glowing after 3 facials – let’s keep the momentum!”_             |
| **Competent, Cordial & Human**                 | Knowledgeable, polite, never insincere.                         | Staff research an answer rather than give a vague response.                                |
| **Attraction, not Chase**                      | Quality & authenticity draw people in; loyalty is earned.       | Invitation-only events replace frequent discount blasts.                                   |
| **Timeless Elegance in Every Detail**          | Classic décor, quality products, refined UX.                    | Treatment rooms feature classic art and natural fragrances.                                |
| **Unwavering Respect for All**                 | Inclusivity & confidentiality are non-negotiable.               | Personal details shared in treatment remain private.                                       |

These principles influence UI copy, notification tone, colour selection, and even performance budgets (luxury feels smooth, never rushed).
